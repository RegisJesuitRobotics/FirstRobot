Here is a list of things that need done for the project:

# Make sure that the logic from the following files are integrated
#   with Gradle and then removed
  projects/team/team3729/build.properties
  projects/team/team3729/build.xml



For the common projects (cscore, wpilib, networktables): try to find
 a way to download them from maven central or jcenter and/or grab the
 source code and compile it locally or make it available for debugging
 Also, post some links to their webpages and how to update the .jars that
 we have locally.

Document how to set up developer environments

Create a Gradle task to automatically deploy the .jar file to the robot
